					<description><![CDATA[Information for cooking apple dried fruit compote]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dried fruits retain all the vitamins and minerals of fresh fruits, so doctors and nutritionists recommend including dried fruits in your diet, especially in the autumn-winter period, when the body needs support.</p>
<p>Dried apples are used in cooking: cooking compote or making snacks.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Classic apple compote recipe</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Water &#8211; 2-3 liters.</li>
<li>Apple drying &#8211; 300-400 grams.</li>
<li>Sugar &#8211; 150 grams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the amount of water and sugar, depending on the portions and personal taste preferences, if you want a sweeter, then you need to add more sugar. If desired, you can add other dried fruits or cook only from apples.</p>
<p><strong>Stages of preparation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rinse dry fruits and soak in water for 1-2 hours.</li>
<li>Pour water into the pan. Always select containers larger than the estimated volume of water. During cooking, the apples rise up, which leads to the crowding out of the liquid.</li>
<li>Put apples and sugar in boiling water to taste. Cook for 30-40 minutes.</li>
<li>Cool and let it brew for 1 hour.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eating compote is tastier when chilled.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">How to cook compote in a multicooker</h4>
<p>The set of ingredients remains unchanged: apples, water, and sugar. Rinse the dried fruits with water, soak for 1-2 hours, and then drain the water through a colander and wait a few minutes until the liquid runs off completely.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the prepared fruits in a multicooker, add sugar and pour water.</li>
<li>Select the program “Compote” or “Drinks”, if there is no such program &#8211; “Soup” or “Stew”. Cooking time 1-1.5 hours, depending on the model. During cooking, the valve must be turned to position 1.</li>
<li>After readiness to insist 30-40 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apples are rich in fiber, iron, organic acids, phosphorus, potassium and other beneficial ingredients for people of any age.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Everything you need to know about Gluten-Free]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Gluten-Free</h5>
<p>Gluten or gluten is found in all products displayed in the supermarket. Manufacturers use vegetable protein to extend shelf life, to add viscosity and density. The substance is found in sausages, dairy products, in baked goods, beer, chips, and even tablets.</p>
<p>Gluten is harmless for 98% of the inhabitants of our planet, but people who lead a healthy lifestyle prefer to arrange fasting days or sit on a gluten-free diet. It is necessary to distinguish between products containing natural vegetable protein (wheat, rye, oats, barley) and products containing artificial gluten, which is dangerous.<br />
Gluten-free foods include nuts, honey, meat, stewed fruit, tea, natural dairy products, and dried fruits.</p>
<p>Dried fruits are one of the most popular snacks, especially apple snacks. Many people use dried fruit for stewing, baking, or eating like snacks during a snack.</p>
<h5>How to choose dried fruits without gluten?</h5>
<p>Natural fruits will never contain gluten, but as then, vegetable protein gets into dried fruits.<br />
Almost all types of dried fruits presented in large stores and even in markets are chemically treated. Manufacturers use dyes, sugar, and other harmful components to give an attractive appearance and increase shelf life.<br />
When choosing snacks, pay attention to the composition and appearance, excessive shine, unnatural color, and perfect fruit should alert. All this indicates a chemical treatment.</p>
<p>It is better to dry apples or pears on your own or choose eco-products on our website.</p>
<h5>What is dangerous gluten?</h5>
<p>Disruption of the digestive tract, abdominal pain, deterioration of the skin, irritability, developmental delay in children &#8211; this is not the whole list of negative effects of gluten on the body. Be attentive to your health and choose natural products.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dried fruits and weight loss]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dried fruits became real superfoods when nutritionists and doctors started talking about them. Preserving the full vitamin and mineral complex and without contraindications, they won the love of the sweet tooth, who want to overcome their addiction and all adherents of healthy nutrition and sports. But is it that dried fruits are useful during weight loss, as they are said.</p>
<p>The first thing that causes suspicion is the sugar content and simple carbohydrates, these components increase the calorie content. For example, 100 grams of dried apricots contains 50 grams of sugar, and the calorie content of apples is 231 kcal per 100 grams of the product.</p>
<h5>What do the experts say?</h5>
<p>Nutritionists recommend that you do not abuse dried fruits by eating no more than 3-5 pieces a day. This applies to raisins, apples, pears, prunes. Also, diabetics should be treated with such accuracy and consult a specialist before inclusion in the diet.<br />
Dried fruits are also present in well-known diets. So the Ducan diet recommends eating dry fruits once a week due to the high content of carbohydrates. In the 6-petal diet, based on fruits, it is allowed to drink compote from dried fruits (apples, figs, dried apricots) and at the end of each week consume no more than 5 pieces at a time.</p>
<p><strong>The main advice</strong> &#8211; you can eat dry fruits only after the main meal, so as not to violate the daily norm, eating fasting is very likely to overeat.</p>
<p>The most affordable product is dried apples. They contain vitamins of group B, PP, C, calcium, potassium, iron, phosphorus and other substances necessary for the body. By including them in the diet, the level of energy increases significantly, stress and insomnia pass.</p>
<p>For complete weight loss, complex products are not needed; everything that is good for the body is found in plant foods. It is necessary to receive micro and macrocells in natural ways, unfortunately, medicines can never replace fruits and vegetables.</p>
